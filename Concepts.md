## Core Principles 

### What is an agent

Agents are systems that independently accomplish tasks on your behalf.

### Difference between agent and traditional software

While conventional software enables users to streamline and automate workflows, agents are able to perform the same workflows on users’ behalf with a high degree of independence.

Applications that integrate LLMs but don’t use them to control workflow execution, such as simple chatbots, single-turn LLMs are not agents.

### Core characteristics of agents

1. It leverages an LLM to manage workflow execution and make decisions. It recognizes when a workflow is complete and can proactively correct its actions if needed. In case of failure, it can halt execution and transfer control back to the user.

2. It has access to various tools to interact with external systems, both to gather context and to take actions. It can dynamically select the appropriate tools depending on the workflow’s current state, always operating within clearly defined guardrails.
